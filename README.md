A board game I found at a puzzle store in Jerusalem. Decided to make it a web app

See the demo at http://paradox.jit.su/

This is still very early stages of development. I wanted to first get the game logic working (which I have).
Then I plan on adding support for playing over the network (against facebook friends) and dramatically improving the game interface.
